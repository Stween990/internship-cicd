Welcome to your very first coding technical challenge. We want to know more about you and your coding skills so that we can create the most customized learning path for you to learn.

CHALLENGE
The challenge itself is that you need to run a script (you can call it whatever you want) to read to a specific URL. If the response has changed, you need to download the "artifact" which is a specific file and then you need to run it. Otherwise, you don't need to update it.

The type of data available for the response is a string composed by numbers and separated by dots. I.e: 1.1.0.1, 1.1.0.2
The script must log as well when the new version is found.
